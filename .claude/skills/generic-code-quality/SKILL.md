# Code Quality Standards

Language-agnostic standards. React/TypeScript examples are illustrative; the principles apply to C#, JS, TS, Python, anything.

## Comments

Default: **no comments**. Well-named identifiers carry the WHAT.

- **No design narrative in code.** If rationale, architecture, trade-offs, or invariants live in `docs/design/<feature>.md` or `docs/requirements/`, do not duplicate as code headers or doc-comments. Link from the design doc to the code, not the other way around.
- **Do not reference tasks, gates, PRs, requirement IDs, or task history** in code (no "Gate 5 wires…", "PoC: deferred until…", "see UR-IDV-013"). That belongs in commit messages, design docs, or decision logs (`memory/decisions.md`).
- **Keep only WHY comments**, and only when the WHY is non-obvious AND not captured nearby in a design doc: hidden constraints, subtle invariants, workarounds for specific bugs, platform quirks that would surprise a reader. One short line is almost always enough.
- Before writing a comment, ask: would removing this confuse a future reader who has read the relevant design doc? If no, don't write it.

## Control flow

- **Early returns (guard clauses)** over nested `if/else`.
- Handle simple / default case first → return → main logic at top indentation.
- A method/function with three levels of nesting almost always has a missed guard.

## Test discipline

Existing tests are the project's behavioural memory. Don't edit them because you happen to be in the file. The right action depends on the work type:

| Work type | What to do with tests |
|---|---|
| **New feature** | Write **new** tests only. Add to existing test files or create new ones. **Do not modify** existing tests. If a new test seems to conflict with an existing one, the existing test is probably wrong — flag it, don't silently rewrite it. |
| **Bug fix** | Write a **new** test that reproduces the bug. Modify an existing test only if it was insufficient (i.e. it *should* have caught this bug but didn't). When modifying, document why in the commit message — that's the audit trail of "we strengthened this test because it missed bug X." |
| **Changing an existing feature** | Modify the **existing** tests for that feature. This is the only case where editing existing tests is the primary action. New tests welcome for newly-added paths. |
| **Refactoring** | Tests should not change at all. If a refactor requires test changes, it's not a refactor — it's a behavioural change. Stop, reclassify, and follow the appropriate row. |

### Anti-patterns

- **Editing an unrelated test "while you're in there"** to make it pass after your change. Either your change broke it (revert and reconsider) or the test was already wrong (flag separately, fix in its own commit).
- **Loosening an existing assertion** (`expect(x).toBe(5)` → `expect(x).toBeGreaterThan(0)`) to make it pass. Tighten or rewrite deliberately; never loosen to chase green.
- **Removing a test because "it's now redundant"** without a clear duplication. Tests catch regressions; over-keeping is safer than over-pruning.
- **Renaming a test to match new behaviour.** If the behaviour changed, the test is now wrong on its assertions — fix those, don't just rename.
- **Adding `[Skip]` / `.skip` / `.only` to a flaky existing test** to keep CI green for the current PR. Flaky tests get fixed or quarantined with a dated TODO, not silently muted.

## File Size Limits

| Type | Target | Maximum |
|------|--------|---------|
| Components | 150-200 lines | 300 lines |
| Hooks | 150-200 lines | 300 lines |
| Utilities | 150-200 lines | 300 lines |

**If approaching limit**: Split into smaller, focused modules using composition.

## Separation of Concerns

Each module should have ONE clear responsibility:

### Components
- **Presentation**: Render UI based on props
- **Container**: Orchestrate data and state for children
- **Layout**: Handle positioning and structure

### Hooks
- **State management**: One domain of state
- **Data fetching**: One data source
- **Side effects**: One category of effects
- **Event handlers**: One category of events

### Utilities
- **Pure functions**: No side effects
- **Single purpose**: One transformation or calculation

## SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/component does ONE thing
- **Open/Closed**: Can extend without modifying existing code
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions (types/interfaces)

## React Best Practices

- **No prop drilling**: Use composition or context for props beyond 2 levels
- **Memoization**: Use `useMemo`/`useCallback` for expensive operations only
- **Type safety**: All props/returns properly typed (no `any`)
- **Error boundaries**: Wrap risky components where appropriate
- **Loading states**: Clear indicators for async operations

## File Organization

Place code in the correct location:

| Type | Location |
|------|----------|
| Shared hooks | `packages/hooks/` |
| Shared utilities | `packages/utils/` |
| Shared UI components | `packages/ui/` |
| App-specific hooks | `spa/apps/frontend/hooks/` or feature folder |
| App-specific utils | `spa/apps/frontend/lib/utils/` |
| App-specific components | `spa/apps/frontend/components/` or feature folder |
| Feature-specific code | Feature folder (co-located) |

## Code Duplication

- Extract patterns repeated 2+ times
- Place shared code in appropriate location:
  - `packages/utils/` - Pure utility functions
  - `packages/hooks/` - Shared React hooks
  - `packages/ui/` - Shared UI components
  - Feature folder - Feature-specific shared code

## Red Flags (Refactor Immediately)

- File exceeds 200 lines
- Function/hook has multiple responsibilities
- Code duplicated 2+ times
- Complex nested logic (>3 levels deep)
- Component has >5 props that aren't variants/handlers
- Prop drilling beyond 2 levels

## Package-Specific Patterns

Refer to package CLAUDE.md files for detailed patterns:
- `packages/ui/CLAUDE.md` - Component patterns, CVA, shadcn/ui
- `packages/hooks/CLAUDE.md` - Hook development patterns
- `packages/utils/CLAUDE.md` - Utility function patterns

## Before Presenting Code

1. Check file line count
2. Verify single responsibility
3. Scan for duplication
4. Review nesting depth
5. Confirm all types are explicit (no `any`)
